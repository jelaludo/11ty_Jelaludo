  <p>Palette: 
  Background: #121212 (charcoal black)
  Primary Text: #E0E0E0 (light gray)
  Secondary Text: #B0B0B0 (medium gray)
  Borders/Dividers: #444444 (dark gray)
  Accent: #888888 (soft gray)</p>

  <p>Implemented EXIF metadata by adding a prebuild script (scripts/extract-exif.js) that walks the gallery entries, parses image metadata with the exifr library, normalizes fields (model, lens, focal length, exposure, image size, resolution, flash), and saves them to src/_data/exif.json; the single-photo template (src/feature.njk) then reads that JSON to render the metadata block.</p>
